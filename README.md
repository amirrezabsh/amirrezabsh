## 🧠 About Me  

I’m a passionate developer and AI researcher who loves turning ideas into impactful, real-world systems.  
From building scalable **AI-driven analytics** and **computer vision** pipelines to developing **full-stack dashboards**,  
I focus on creating efficient, production-ready solutions that blend **engineering**, **AI**, and **user experience**.

💡 My professional journey includes:
- Building large-scale **computer vision systems** for people counting (YOLOv8, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, FastAPI).  
- Conducting **AI research** on motor learning and clustering (FCM, optimization, 90% accuracy).  
- Teaching **Python programming** to students and mentoring teams on real projects.  
- Developing **Telegram bots**, **Unity games**, and **Angular/Ionic dashboards** serving thousands of users.
